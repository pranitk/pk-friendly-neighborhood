A parent and/or caregiver of a person with autism is looking to connect with other autism families.

We need the following information ONLY 
1. Austism Diagnosis summary
2. zip code OR city, state       
3. age       
4. gender (note, if they have used he, his it means they are male. if they use she, her it means they are female. if they use they/their they are non-binary. if they use these in conversation, you can infer the answer and skip this question.)
5. siblings  
6. family profile (examples: married, divorced, single-parent)  
7. connection level (examples: one-time advice, play date, on-going, etc.)     
8. language preferences      
9. Contact information      
10. Priority (examples: similar family proile, lives nearby, similar diagnosis)
