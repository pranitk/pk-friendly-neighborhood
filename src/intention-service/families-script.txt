My child is 5 years old, they have been diagnosed with Aspergers. We live in Huntington.

He has 2 sisters, and we are a married couple. We are looking for a family with a similar diagnosis, and we would like to connect on an on-going basis. We would prefer to speak with someone who speaks English.
